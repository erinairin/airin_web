        <p>My primary school, Sekolah Kebangsaan Bandar Sungai Buaya, was near my
	house which is 5 minutes to arrive. Here I learned the basics and developed
	a love for learning. Honestly, I did not really excell in academic during my
	primary time. I was more focused on curriculum activity such as Puteri Islam
	and handball. During my involvement in Puteri Islam, I participate in Donut
	making competition. Me and my partner win the first round that lead us to the
	next round which is as a representative of the district, Hulu Selangor. We win
	second place and successfully made the school proud. Other than that, I also
	joined handball as a wall position. I remember how hard me and my team pracice
	to participate in the competition amongst all schools in Hulu Selangor. For this
	competition, we win and get to participate on the next level which is a
	representative of Hulu selangor along with all district schools. I remember
	I receive a certificate for Tokoh Wirama in Handball. In academic, i did excell
	in some years which allow me to join and got awarded during end-year excellent
	award ceremony. I realize that primary school was a crucial part of my foundation
	in education that makes me who I am today.</p>

        </div>
        <p>When High School started, I begin to focus more on my academic goals
	and tone down my sports and curricular activities. I got better in terms
	of grades during this time. I started to score in science, got B in Math
	for the first time during my PT3 exam, and tried to excell in other subjects.
	I was so proud of myself for trying so hard to work on the academic that i
	once never really focused on. During form 4 and form 5, I was assigned business
	class as my core subject. Covid-19 hit during that time that made me kind of
	losing focused in academic. I got to admit that studying alone at home without
	friends and teachers to teach you physically was so hard. It challenge me to be
	more focused on class, which I found it really hard to do. But, I still have good
	times with my high school friends as we take the challenges together, supported
	each other and be satisfied with our SPM result. My high school was really the
	jumping stone of my life that makes me want to do better in the future.</p>

        </div>
        <p>Diploma starts in 2022. I remember applying for diploma and putting
	Information Management as my fist choice because I read somewhere that
	you rarely get the first choice. But here I am, studying Information
	Management in Segamat, Johor. Far away from home. I was so conflicted
	with my decision when I get to know that I get a far campus because I
	never stayed this far away from home. But Alhamdulillah, I like how my
	life turned out now. I am currently in my final semester of diploma.
	I had to admit that it was not an easy journey. Learning something that
	was never my intention or interest, it was tiring, challenging, stressful
	and complicated but I enjoy it anyway. I got good grades all thanks to Allah,
	my groupmates and my hard work. It is also bearable because I got to meet kind
	people along the way. I do think that all the people that I met during diploma
	would be the most memorable people have ever met in life. Thank you to my classmates,
	groupmates and my dimploma bestfriends who have made this especially hard journey fun.
	Without them, I would not be the person I am today. For my own hope, I hope my future
	self will be so much better than who I am today and may succes accompany me along all
	my journey.</p>
