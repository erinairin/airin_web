            <p>Family means having someone to love you unconditionally in spite of you and your shortcomings.
	    Family means loving and supporting one another even when it's not easy to do so. It’s being the
            best person you could be so that you may inspire your love ones. Family is unrelenting, it’s secure
            and reliable. Family isn’t just important, it’s what is most important!</p>
	    <p>This section of my webpage is for me to show some appreciation to my family who I always seek
	    for when in hard times and happy times. To the ones who gives me courage and believe in me for
            doing things that are good for my future, THIS IS FOR YOU.</p>

        <h1>Hari Raya Tradition</h1>

        </div>
        <p>It originally contain 7 people including my parents, brothers, sisters and me. As time goes by,
	both of my brothers got married to their spouse and added another two person into our family, and
	from then on, it became bigger and bigger as i am now an aunt of two nephew.</p>

	<p>most of my sibligs already live on their own especially my brothers and sister-in-law as they have
	their own little family now. Whenever we gather around my parents' house, we rarely take family photos
	like this. It usually happen during raya, especially on the first day of raya during midnight. Both are
	taken around the same time but one year apart. I love how even though it's midnight, our energy are still
	high that it makes all of our raya photos look good.</p>

        <h1>People I Love Most</h1>

            <img src="image/fam5.jpg" alt="wedwedwed">
        </div>
        <p>This special section are meant to highlight these two people that i called Ayah and Ibu, who have made
	my life bearable. Ayah and ibu has made my life so much easier without me realizing it up until I have
	become an adult. They always work hard to give me the things that I need and want in life that it makes me
	realize that being a parents are not as easy as how they make it looked like. They never really show their
	struggles to satisfy the needs of their family. Always try and try until they know that we got everything
	that we need.</p>
	<p>Ofcourse we did not always get what we want. Ibu and Ayah always told me that "if you want something,
	save your own money". I remember how I bought my first phone using my duit raya and school allowance. And
	ever since, I always worked on it myself most of the time. Even on things that they can obviously afford
	for me, they always encourage me to be more responsible with money and the way I plan and manage life for
	the best future. Growing older, I realize that this practice are not all about money. It thought me so much
	more as a person, how your own hardwork can bring you to success and to the things that you want. I also
	learn how responsibility are so important in life that living with it can make me closer to my target in life.</p>

	<p>Thankyou for all your love and sacrifices that have been made while raising our family, Ayah and Ibu.</p>

        <h1>My Serotonin Booster</h1>

        <p>And this is my nephews. They are my second brother's sons and they are very cheeky and energetic.
	My first nephew named Aisy Naufal and his little brother named Aisy Nazhan. Naufal is 6 years old and
	he is really active. He likes badminton so much after their dad sent them to badminton classes a few
	times. He now wanted to be a number one badminton player, well even greater than number one.
	Everytime they came to my parents' house, Naufal always asked everyone to play badminton match with him,
	nonstop but his aunts are not really an active people so me and my sisters only entertain him with two round each.</p>
	<p>Nazhan is 3 years old, and also very energetic. He does not have one interest yet. What I can say is that
	he is really into cars, fishing and food. Yup, he can eat my portion of food. That's how a big eater he is.
	Well, when you eat big, your energy are also big. He is also the cheekiest among them two. He knows how to
	talk funny about other people and how random he can be sometimes. The way he talks about something never
	fails to make the whole family laugh.</p>

	<p>One thing about having a nephew is that you always want to buy something for them. As for me, I always wanted
	to buy them things such as:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Clothes</li>
            <li>Toy car</li>
            <li>Dessert</li>
            <li>Cute badminton racket</li>
        </ol>
        <p>To my family, Thank you for everything that you have done that makes me who I am today. I am very grateful
	to have you as part of my life forever. Much Love!</p>
